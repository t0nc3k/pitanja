Description:

	TCExam is a software solution (CBA - Computer-Based Assessment) to
	drastically simplify the evaluation process for schools, universities,
	recruiting firms as well as private and public companies, allowing
	professors, teachers and examiners to create, distribute and manage exams,
	tests, surveys and quizzes.

	Compared to the traditional Pen-and-Paper Testing (PPT), TCExam simplifies
	the whole process of evaluation reducing costs and improving quality and
	reliability of the examinations.

	TCExam comes in a variety of languages and is already used all over the
	world by top universities, schools, private and public institutions,
	independent educators and research centers.

	KEY FEATURES

	* Flexibility and Configurability: The system has been designed to offer a
	high degree of adaptability to cover a great variety of usage scenarios.
	Numerous configuration features allow customizing TCExam to fit all possible
	requirements.

	* Free Open Source Software (FOSS): TCExam software is distributed with
	GNU-AGPLv3 license. Open Source promotes Software reliability and quality by
	supporting independent peer review and rapid evolution of the source code.

	* Web-based Architecture: TCExam is Web-based and developed with LAMP
	(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) technology. User-friendly interface allows you
	to install and use TCExam by simply connecting one cable to the switch of
	your computer network. All the computers on the network will be able to use
	TCExam independently from the client’s operating system as a normal intranet
	website, with no need to install any additional software or plug-in.

	* Internationalization (I18N): TCExam is language-independent through the
	adoption of the UTF-8, Unicode and  TMX standards. It supports the
	Right-To-Left mode and currently includes translations in 23 different
	languages.

	* Accessibility and Usability: TCExam Web interface conforms to the XHTML
	1.0 Strict standard, the guidelines on Accessibility (W3C-WAI-WCAG 1.0) and
	Usability, to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with
	disabilities, including blindness.

	* Results and Statistics: TCExam outputs a variety of result pages, enabling
	various selection filters and providing numerous statistical indexes.
	Results and statistics can then be exported into various formats for filing
	or reworking. The test-takers can immediately be informed of the result of
	their test, or have it delivered via email.

	* Data Import and Export: TCExam uses Open Standard protocols for data
	filing and interchange: TSV, XML and PDF. Everything is fully documented to
	be easily extended or used by external applications. Custom filters can be
	added to import data from other systems. Include Optical Mark Recognition
	(OMR) system to import users' answers from paper sheets. TCExam supports
	several types of remote authentication and single-sign-on protocols: LDAP,
	RADIUS, CAS.

	* Multimedia Content: TCExam uses a common mark-up language to add text
	formatting, images, multimedia objects (audio and video) and mathematical
	formulas (supports LaTeX).

	* Unique Tests: TCExam can simultaneously generate unique tests for
	different users by randomly selecting and sorting questions and alternative
	answers. This feature drastically reduces or eliminates the chances of
	cheating on the test.

	* Paper Testing with Optical Character Recognition (OMR): TCExam can
	generate printable PDF documents for pen-and-paper testing. The OMR answer
	sheet can be scanned and uploaded to TCExam for automatic test importing,
	scoring and reporting.

	* Security: TCExam is more secure than traditional Pen-and-Paper testing.
	It supports SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption and includes various
	authentication levels to discriminate the access to the various sections
	(user/password, access level, group, IP address). Test time, test activity,
	results, and statistics: every part of the test is managed and stored in the
	server, leaving no sensitive data in the users’ client computers.
